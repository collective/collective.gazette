This package is based on ideas of PloneGazette but is not compatible with
the PloneGazette newsletter nor subscribers database.

It aims to support automated newsletters *not* based on collections, but on
developer defined newsletter providers. Each provider provides a HTML snippet
added to the newsletter issue in order defined in newsletter settings.

There are two types of newsletters:

- manual
- automated

Manual issues are just simple Plone pages with static content sent to defined list of subscribers.
Manual newsletter also supports a provider, but it should be mostly used as static text issue of
the newsletter.

Automated issues are issued from a cron script or other periodical URL call source. You can define
parameters for the automated issues in GazetteFolder settings - like Subject, Body text (prepended
to the providers text), ordered list of providers and HTML template, where you can define a CSS,
for example. Calling gazette-folder/@@auto-issue browser view will go through all providers and
collects HTML for the issue. The issue is created as an object in the gazettefolder. The Gazette issue
object contains the HTML text and attached PDF version of the issue (wkhtmltopdf required).

Providers are simple utilities providing IGazetteTextProvider interface. There is one method,
get_gazette_text, which returns HTML code generated by the provider. __repr__ method of the
providers returns string representation of provider name used in the providers vocabulary field.

collective.gazette is using cornerstone.soup package to store subscriber data.
